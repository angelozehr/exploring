This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find a running version of it on [http://www.exploring.sg/](https://www.exploring.sg/)

Feel free to copy or contribute (e.g. for other cities)

### To-Dos:

- maybe move to css modules?
